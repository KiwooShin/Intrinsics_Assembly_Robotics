## 2026-07-12 ~13:00 — Session start

Orchestration kicked off: 5 Opus recon sub-agents launched in parallel (Phase-1
requirements, code/environment audit, and 3 literature lanes: IL/Transformer
architectures, RL/refinement, data strategy), and repo-wide engineering rules
were codified in `CLAUDE.md` (Google style + unittests, git workflow, 2-hourly
reporting, public checkpoints allowed). Environment state from 24 days ago
(deployment-runtime blocker, 16-episode dataset, `v2_wide.pt` checkpoint) is
being re-verified by the audit agent before any execution decisions.

**Next 2 h:** collect recon reports → synthesize the research + execution plan
(`ResearchPlan-2026-07.md`), decide the deployment-runtime fix, launch first
implementation sub-agents (deploy-and-score the existing checkpoint; restart
data expansion), and start the 48-hour heartbeat.
